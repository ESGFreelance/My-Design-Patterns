# C# Referential Patterns
 This repository is my reference for the basic implementation of design patterns and other techniques so that if ever I forgot something then I will just go in this repository.
 
 The basics and the design patterns were also documented using Microsoft Visio so that I can immediately edit and save the changes if there's any.
 
# USAGE
